# genetical
An implementation of Genetics Algorithms for Node JS

## Install

You can install using Node Package Manager (npm):

    npm install genetical

## Usage

You can see an example in `test/helloWorldStringTest.js`. The goal is to evolve a population of randomly-generated strings until at least one matches a specified target string, in this case `HELLO WORLD`

Another example is in `test/combinationExample.js`. The goal is minimizing the value of function f (x) = ((a + 2b + 3c + 4d) - 30)

I will complete this section soon, I promise :smile:
